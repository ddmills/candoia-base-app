# Candoia Base App
This project demonstrates some of the capabilities of a Candoia app.

To get started:

1. `git clone` this repository to your machine.
2. Open Candoia, and click on `install app` in the footer.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the app list, and click the `install from local` button.
4. Click `browse` and find the location that you saved this repository.
5. Choose the `package.json` in this repository.
6. Check the `Developer Mode` box.
7. Click `install` button

Now you can run the `Base App` on any repository in Candoia. When the app is ran, you'll see the developer console. If you make changes to the app, refresh the app by either closing and reopening it, or pressing `cmd+r` on OSX or `f5` on Windows.
